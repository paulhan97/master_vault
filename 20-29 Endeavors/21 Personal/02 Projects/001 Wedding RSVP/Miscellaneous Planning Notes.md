3 types of components to sections of the form:
* Dynamic content based on data from Google Sheet
* Static content that is always the same for that section
* Dynamic content that is based on user interaction

A complete design will have to:
* Outline a section based on a mixed template with the ordered components
* Fill in each component based on different events (e.g. page load, data fetch) in the proper order
