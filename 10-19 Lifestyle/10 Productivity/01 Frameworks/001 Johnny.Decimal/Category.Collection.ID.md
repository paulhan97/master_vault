[[Johnny.Decimal]] > Category.Collection.ID

For something as intricate as a second brain, the Johnny.Decimal system lacks enough indices to account for an ultra-wide scope of interests.

This introduces the need to add an addition to existing constructs of areas, categories and IDs. 

Hence, the **Collection** is born. This addition changes the index format to:
`00.00.000`
- The first 2 digits stay traditionally as a category
- The 2 digits in-between periods becomes a collection
- The last 3 digits are now IDs

A collection is a grouping of uniform records. For example, if you have a category called `Software Development`, you could have a collection called `Projects`. 

This circumvents the all too likely scenario that you will have more than 99 projects while also avoiding the sub-optimal alternatives of:
- Eating up category slots with `Personal Projects`, `Commercial Projects`, etc.
- Making `Software Development` an area

Instead, you can have the hierarchy of `Career`.`Software Development`.`Projects` which can be much clearer without much added complexity.
