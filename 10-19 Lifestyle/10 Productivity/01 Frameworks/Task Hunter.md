# Task Hunter
This is a to-do framework inspired by the literature and media representations of the dangerous jobs-for-hire trope. 

Some examples of this trope would be:
- Guilds in *Fairy Tail*
- The Yorozuya in *Gintama*
- Rescue Teams from *Pokemon Mystery Dungeon*

## How it works

### Task
Every task is composed of a description and reward.

#### Description
The goal of a description is to explain the scope of the task in both a fun and clear way.

[!tip] Some pointers in writing descriptions
- Be matter-of-fact when it comes to the specific milestones
- Have fun with some added fictitious back-story
- Don't exceed 500 characters

#### Reward
A monetary value associated with the task. The aim is to estimate a fair market value based on the circumstances of a professional freelancer being hired to do the task.
