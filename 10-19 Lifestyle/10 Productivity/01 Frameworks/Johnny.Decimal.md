# Purpose of Design

## Gain Context
At a glance, you can get an idea of the type of information your item holds and roughly identify the relative timeframe of when it was completed. 

## Speed Up Communication
Telling someone, including yourself, the reference to an item is short and sweet.

## Prevent Displacement
The system is extensible in the sense that new entries will not alter the position of prior entries. 

# How it works
- Assign an ID to *everything*
  - Format: `00.00`
  - The first digit before the decimal represents an **Area**
  - The second digit before the decimal represents a **Category**
  - The last two digits after the decimal represent an **ID**

## What is a Category?
Plainly speaking, a *category* is a set of like-things. 

Some pointers on defining the scope of a category:
- Prefer broader categories (The No-More Than 10 Rule)
- For example, `investments`, `budget`, and `savings` can be condensed to `finance`

## What is an Area?
*Areas* group categories. They represent broad-band scopes of your life.

> [!tip] The No-More Than 10 Rule
> At most, an area can contain 10 categories (e.g. 10-19, 20-29, etc.)

>[!info] Name Convention
>Areas are labeled in the following format:
>`10-19 Name of Area`

## What is an ID?
Perhaps the most ambiguous of the 3 constructs, the *ID* represents a "thing", the whole of tightly-coupled parts.

These parts may include:
- Tasks
- Resources
- Meetings
- Artifacts

> [!tip] The No-Risk of 100 Rule
> At most, a category can have 99 things. Be careful not to define too broad of a category.
