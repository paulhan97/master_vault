## Purpose of Design

### Gain Context
At a glance, you can get an idea of the type of information your item holds and roughly identify the relative timeframe of when it was completed. 

### Speed Up Communication
Telling someone, including yourself, the reference to an item is short and sweet.

### Prevent Displacement
The system is extensible in the sense that new entries will not alter the position of prior entries. 

## How it works
- Assign an ID to *everything*
  - Format: `00.00`
  - The 2 digits before the decimal represent an **Area**
  - The 2 digits after the decimal represent a **Category**

### What is a Category?
Plainly speaking, a *category* is a collection of like-things. 

Some pointers on defining the scope of a category:
- Prefer broader categories (The No-More Than 10 Rule)
- For example, `investments`, `budget`, and `savings` can be condensed to `finance`

### What is an Area?
Areas group categories. They represent broad-band scopes of your life.

[!tip] The No-More Than 10 Rule
At most, an area can contain 10 categories (e.g. 10-19, 20-29, etc.)

[!info] Name Convention
Areas are given names in the following format
